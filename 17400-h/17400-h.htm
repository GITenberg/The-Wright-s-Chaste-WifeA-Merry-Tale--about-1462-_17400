<div class = "mynote"><b>Transcriber's note:</b><br /><br />
This e-text uses a number of characters that depend on utf-8 encoding,
particularly small and capital yogh (&#541;, &#540;), small and capital thorn (&thorn;, &THORN;), double l with a tilde through (l&#820;l&#820;),
u with a macron (&#363;), h with a line through the top (&#295;), r with a upwards hook attached to the horizontal
stem (r&#795;) and ae ligature with an acute accent (&#509;). If they do not display properly,
you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable fonts. As a first
resort, try changing your browser's default font.<br /><br />
This e-text also uses some characters that are not in unicode. I have rendered them following:<br />
{m~} for a m with a loop back over the character, which looks like
<img src="images/01.jpg" height="25" width="25" alt="m with a loop back over the character" title="m with a loop back over the character" /><br />
{n)} for a n with a ) attached to the right side, which looks like
<img src="images/02.jpg" height="25" width="20" alt="n with a ) attached to the right side" title="n with a ) attached to the right side" /><br />
{d+} for the d with a little crook attached to the top right of the d, which looks like
<img src="images/03.jpg" height="25" width="19" alt="d with a little crook attached to the top right of the d" title="d with a little crook attached to the top right of the d" /><br />
There is also one instance of (on line 391 of the poem) a m with a ) attached to the right side (rendered as
{m)} and looks like<img src="images/04.jpg" height="25" width="23" alt="m with a ) attached to the right side" title="m with a ) attached to the right side" />),
but this is probably a typo for {m~}. I have left this as is.<br /><br />
Text and letters in brackets [&nbsp;] is original.<br /><br />
Obvious typos are corrected in this e-text and are shown with

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Good wine needs no bush, and this tale needs no Preface. I shall not
tell the story of it&mdash;let readers go to the verse itself for that; nor
shall I repeat to those who begin it the exhortation of the englisher of
<i>Sir Generides</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"for goddes sake, or ye hens wende,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here this tale unto the ende."&mdash;(ll. 3769-70.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If any one having taken it up is absurd enough to lay it down without
finishing it, let him lose the fun, and let all true men pity him.
Though the state of morals disclosed by the story is not altogether
satisfactory, yet it is a decided improvement on that existing in Roberd
of Brunne's time in 1303, for he had to complain of the lords of his
day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Also do &thorn;ese lordynges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&THORN;e[y] trespas moche yn twey &thorn;ynges;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&THORN;ey rauys a mayden a&#541;ens here wyl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mennys wyuys &thorn;ey lede awey &thorn;ertyl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grete vylanye &thorn;arte he dous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#540;yf he make therof hys rouse [boste]:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&THORN;e dede ys confusyun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more ys &thorn;e dyffamacyun.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>The volume containing the poem was shown to me by Mr Stubbs, the
Librarian at Lambeth, in order that I might see the version of Sir
Gyngelayne, son of Sir Gawain, which Mr Morris is some day, I trust, to
edit for the Society in one of his Gawain volumes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Finding the
present poem also on the paper leaves, I copied it out the same
afternoon, and here it is for a half-hour's amusement to any reader who
chooses to take it up.</p>

<p>The handwriting of the MS. must be of a date soon after 1460, and this
agrees well with the allusion to Edward the Fourth's accession, and the
triumph of the White Rose o'er the Red alluded to in the last lines of
the poem. The Garlond,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was made ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flourys most of honoure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of roses whyte &thorn;at wyl&#820;l&#820; nott fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whych floure al&#820;l&#820; ynglond doth glade....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vn-to the whych floure I-wys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loue of God and of the comonys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued bene of ryght.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For, that the Commons of England were glad of their Yorkist king, and
loved Duke Richard's son, let Holinshed's record prove. He testifies:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Wherevpon it was againe demanded of the commons, if they would
admit and take the said erle as their prince and souereigne lord;
which all with one voice cried: Yea, yea....</p>

<p>"Out of the ded stocke sprang a branch more mightie than the stem;
this Edward the Fourth, a prince so highlie fauoured of the peple,
for his great liberalite, clemencie, vpright dealing, and courage,
that aboue all other, he with them stood in grace alone: by reason
whereof, men of all ages and degrees to him dailie repaired, some
offering themselues and their men to ioepard their liues with him,
and other plentiouslie gaue monie to support his charges, and to
mainteine his right."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Would that we knew as much of Adam of Cobsam as of our White-Rose king.
He must have been one of the Chaucer breed,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but more than this poem
tells of him I cannot learn.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;There are other Poems about Edward IV. in the volume, which will
be printed separately.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One on Women is given at the end of the

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>PP.S. 1869.&mdash;Mr C.H. Pearson, the historian of the Early and Middle Ages
of England, has supplied me with the immediate original of this story.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Wright's Chaste Wife is a reproduction of one of the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, cap. 69, de Castitate, ed. Keller. The Latin story
begins 'Gallus regnavit prudens valde.' The Carpenter gets a shirt
with his wife, which is never to want washing unless one of them is
unfaithful. The lovers are three Knights (<i>milites</i>), and they are
merely kept on bread and water, not made to work; nor is any wife
introduced to see her lord's discomfiture. The English version,
therefore, is much quainter and fuller of incident than its
original. But the 'morality' of the Latin story is rich beyond
description. 'The wife is holy Mother Church,' 'the Carpenter is
the good Christian,' 'the shirt is our Faith, because, as the
apostle says, it is impossible to please God without faith.' The
Wright's work typifies 'the building up the pure heart by the works
of mercy.' The three Knights are 'the pride of life, the lust of
the eyes, and the lust of the flesh.' 'These you must shut up in
the chamber of penance till you get an eternal reward from the
eternal King.' 'Let us therefore pray God,' &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>With the Wright's Chaste Wife may also be compared the stories mentioned
in the Notes, p. 20, and the Ballad "The Fryer well fitted; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Pretty jest that once befel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How a maid put a Fryer to cool in the well"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>printed "in the Bagford Collection; in the Roxburghe (ii. 172); the
Pepys (iii. 145); the Douce (p. 85); and in <i>Wit and Mirth, an Antidote
to Melancholy</i>, 8vo. 1682; also, in an altered form, in Pills to purge
Melancholy, 1707, i. 340; or 1719, iii. 325"; and the tune of which,
with an abstract of the story, is given in Chappell's <i>Popular Music</i>,
i. 273-5. The Friar makes love to the Maid; she refuses him for fear of
hell-fire.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tush, quoth the Friar, thou needst not doubt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wert in Hell, I could sing thee out.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So she consents if he'll bring her an angel of money. He goes home to
fetch it, and she covers the well over with a cloth. When he comes back,
and has given her the money, she pretends that her father is coming,
tells the Friar to run behind the cloth, and down he flops into the
well. She won't help him at first, because if he could sing her out of
hell, he can clearly sing himself out of the well: but at last she does
help him out, keeps his money because he's dirtied the water, and sends
him home dripping along the street like a new-washed sheep.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>


<p>The two first of the three operations of flax-dressing described in
lines 526-529, p. 15,</p>

<p>must correspond to the preliminary breaking of the plant, and then the
scutching or beating to separate the coarse tow or hards from the tare
or fine hemp. <ins class = "correction" title = "Exeept in original">Except</ins> so far as the <i>swingle</i> served as
a heckle, the further <i>heckling</i> of the flax, to render the fibre finer
and cleaner, was dispensed with, though heckles (iron combs) must have
been in use when the poem was written&mdash;inasmuch as <i>hekele</i>, <i>hekelare</i>,
<i>hekelyn</i>, and <i>hekelynge</i>, are in the Promptorium, ab. 1440
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Under <i>Hatchell</i>, Randle Holme gives a drawing of a <ins class = "correction" title = "hcekle in original">heckle</ins>.</p>

<p>The lines through the <i>h</i>'s in the MS. are not, I believe, marks of
contraction. There are no insettings of the third lines, or spaces on
changes of subject, in the MS.</p>

<p>For reference to two analogous stories to that of the Poem, I am
indebted to Mr Thomas Wright. The first is that of <i>Constant Duhamel</i> in
the third volume of Barbazan, and the second that of the Prioress and
her three Suitors in the Minor Poems of Dan John Lydgate, published by
the Percy Society, ed. Halliwell.</p>

<p>In the Barbazan tale "the wife is violently solicited by three suitors,
the priest, the provost, and the forester, who on her refusal persecute
her husband. To stop their attacks she gives them appointments at her
house immediately after one another, so that when one is there and
stripped for the bath, another comes, and, pretending it is her husband,
she conceals them one after another in a large tub full of feathers, out
of which they can see all <ins class = "correction" title = "tbat in original">that</ins> is going on in the room.
She then sends successively for their three wives to come and bathe with
her, the bath being still in the same room, and as each is stripped
naked in the bath, she introduces her own husband, who dishonours them
one after another, one <i>&agrave; l'enverse</i>, with rather aggravating
circumstances, and all in view of their three husbands. Finally the
latter are turned out of the house naked, or rather well feathered, then
hunted by the whole town and their dogs, well bitten and beaten."</p>

<p>(If any one wants to see a justification of the former half of the
proverb quoted by Roberd of Brunne,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Frenche men synne yn lecherye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Englys men yn enuye,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>let him read the astounding revelation made of the state of the early
French mind by the tales in the 3rd and 4th vols. of Barbazan's
Fabliaux, ed. 1808.)</p>

<p>The second story, told by Lydgate, is as follows:&mdash;A prioress is wooed
by "a yonng knyght, a parson of a paryche, and a burges of a borrow."
She promises herself to the first if he will lie for a night in a chapel
sewn up in a sheet like a corpse; to the second, if he will perform the
funeral service over the knight, and bury him; to the third, if he will
dress up like a devil, and frighten both parson and knight. This the
burges Sir John does well, but is himself terrified at the corpse
getting up: all three run away from one another: the knight falls on a
stake, and into a snare set for bucks, and breaks his fore top in
falling from the tree; the merchant gets tossed by a bull; the parson
breaks his head and jumps into a bramble bush; and the prioress gets rid
of them all, but not before she has made the "burges" or "marchaunt" pay
her twenty marks not to tell his wife and the country generally of his
tricks.&mdash;<i>Minor Poems</i>, p. 107-117, ed. 1840.</p>

Knots were often worn as badges, see Edmonston's Heraldry, Appendix, Knots. On the other hand, Willement (Regal Heraldry) notices that the angels attending Richard II. in the picture at Wilton, had collars worked with white roses and broom-buds; and trueloves, if a plant be meant by it, may have been Edward's substitute for the broom (<i>planta genisla</i>). The Trewloves bear, one, Ar. on a chev. sa., three cinquefoils, or; the other, Ar. on a chev. sa., a quatrefoil of the field.</li>

<p>P.S.&mdash;This Poem was printed by Mr Halliwell in <i>Reliqui&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;</i>, vol.
i., p. 248, and reprinted by Mr Thomas Wright, at p. 103 of his edition
of <i>Songs and Carols</i> for the Percy Society, 1847. As, besides minor
differences, the reprint has <i>manne</i>, and the original <i>nanne</i>, for what
I read as <i>nonne</i>, l. 3, while both have <i>withowte</i> for <i>with oure</i>, l.
15, and <i>accripe</i> for <i>a ttripe</i>, l. 21 (see Halliwell's Dictionary,
"<i>accripe</i>, a herb?"), I have not cancelled this impression. The other
version of the song, from Mr Wright's MS. in his text, pp. 89-91,
differs a good deal from that given above.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
